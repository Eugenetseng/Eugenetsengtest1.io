            <p style="border:5px #FFAC55  dashed; max-width:650px;" > &emsp; During the winter vacation, I do almost the samething everyday, I woke up around
                8am and watching TED and  Voicetube, this helped my English skills a lot.
                preview the next semester's math and chemistry. The favorite things I liked to do
                in my free timewere learning programming and practicing basketball in the winter vacation .
                There is one thing I want to mention: I think our class leader made the right dicision of setting
                a rule of watching TED and  Voicetube, this helped my English skills a lot.
